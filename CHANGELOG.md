# Changelog

### Version 1.0.2

- BREAKING CHANGES
    - `setupReactotron` take an object as parameter and not only a string
    - Instead of setup reactotronRedux during the initialization to plug plugin eg redux, we will keep only reactotron's initialization and add plugins as an array and plug to reactotron on the library's side
    
    before: 

    ```javascript
    init({ config: { Reactotron, reactotronRedux, AsyncStorage } });
    setupReactotronWithRedux('app_name');
    ```

    now:

    ```javascript
    init({ config: { Reactotron, AsyncStorage } });
    setupReactotron({ name: 'app_name' }, [reactotronRedux(), ...otherPlugins()]);
